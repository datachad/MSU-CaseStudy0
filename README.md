## User Accounts
3 admin accounts were needed for Contoso Coffe. Bob, Dave, and Mark. The case described the acces they needed. Below is a diagram depicting roles and scope assigned. 

Bob is the owner of Contoso Coffe and is assigned the "Global administrator" role in Azure AD. 

Dave is administrating the website. He is assigned the "Contributor" role to the resource group that contains the website. This is to ensure that he only has access to what he needs to work with the website. 

Mark only requires read access to the resource, hence why he is only assigned the "Reader" role.
